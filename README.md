The rest of the options, if not set, are set to default values.

```javascript
{
    notificationType: 		'error',
	notificationAction:		'none',
	title:					'Workout Completed!',

	messageExtended:		false,
	theme:					'dark',
	time:					'2022-06-04 0:35:00',
	icon:					'hammer-outline',
	animated:				true,
	autodelete:				false
}
```
